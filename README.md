# Sentimental_Analysis_Amazon_Review
dataset holds huge reviews and rating from amazon website. Text is pre-processed and convolutional Neural Net is used to analyse the sentiments of customers on products purchased

# Description: 

•	Created a Model which helps to analyse the sentiments of the users on their purchases of certain products

•	Referred to Kaggle dataset

•	Simple text pre-processing and processing is been taken care of

•	Tried out two fairly unoptimized deep learning models:

      i.	A convolutional neural net
      ii.	A recurrent neural net
      
•	These models have achieved results that would be predicting the binary sentiment of the reviews.
